# The-World-Happiness-Report-

The United Nations has hired you to support a week-long conference as their data specialist to help
analyze the results of the World Happiness Report. The World Happiness Report, published by the UN
Sustainable Development Solutions Network, surveys countries across several quality-of-life
characteristics – such as economy, family, health, freedom, generosity, etc. – to determine a global
happiness ranking. The happiness score is used to rank countries and it is calculated by taking the sum of
all quality-of-life characteristic scores.
